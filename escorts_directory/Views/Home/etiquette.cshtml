						<p>Whether you are booking an escort for the first time or have booked escorts previously, there are some rules of the road regarding booking an escort that you should be familiar with. When you have your escort booking etiquette right, you ensure you have the greatest possible escort encounter which will be an immensely fun and memorable experience for you.</p>
						<p>Escorts are diverse — they come from different backgrounds and are racially diverse as well. Escorts are working in the industry for diverse reasons — some to support themselves financially while others to pay for their tuition and yet others just for the experience. You can keep this in mind as you have a conversation with an escort to get to know her. You can have a wide-ranging conversation with an escort while being aware that there are boundaries and you don't want to intrude on someone's personal motivations for doing what they do.</p>
						<p>You want to be aware of the standard procedures when it comes to paying an escort and asking an escort various questions so that you don't end up feeling awkward such as when a pilot happens to land an airplane on the wrong airport or when a pilot presses the wrong button and starts talking and the ATC and other pilots in the area are able to hear the pilot whereas the pilot meant to speak to the passengers on the airplane!</p>
						<p>When you want to have an exceptionally memorable experience with a stunning escort it is better to know what buttons to press and which buttons do what — you don't want to book a First Class Suite on an Etihad A380 or a Singapore Airlines flight and then have trouble making the best use possible of all the features and amenities that are included in that ticket.</p>
						<p>So, whether it is your first date or not with an escort, here are some basics you need to know so that it is smooth sailing all the way.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Getting the Commitment Right</h2>
						<p>When you desire to meet with an escort, make sure you really do want to meet an escort and also you need to have the date and time fixed in your mind. Once you are sure, you can choose the escort you want to spend time with and send an email or text to that escort. It is a waste of time when you send that email or text and the escort responds and then you have second thoughts or you remember other commitments.</p>
						<p>If you are someone who makes that first contact and then follows through then you will make a good impression on the escort. On the other hand, if you happen to be someone who is not serious about following through, you won't be making as good of an impression. You may even get rejected by the escort if you try to make contact a second time.</p>
						<p>It is like making a commitment to deliver a project on time or if you are a lawyer, filing a legal brief on time. You won't be going far in your career if you are unable to keep your promise to deliver something by a certain time.</p>
						<p>Same with escorts — it is best for you to make sure you are serious about booking an escort before contacting an escort.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Getting the Language Just Right</h2>
						<p>Just as having good language in a dating profile is important to many people — and certainly good language is extremely important in other professional contexts such as when you are applying for a grant or when writing that legal brief or when writing that book proposal — good language comes in handy when you are writing to an escort for the first time.</p>
						<p>Having the language right means there won't be a need for back-and-forth emails to get things clarified. This will save both time and energy.</p>
						<p>So, the way to get things right is by including your name and your cellphone number in your message as well as including the date and time when you would like to meet the escort.</p>
						<p>Mentioning sex explicitly is not advisable since sex work may be criminalized in certain locations.</p>
						<p>When your message is courteous, professional, and accurate you make a good impression with the escort and you will likely have smooth sailing all the way when you manage to start with making the right impression.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Following and meeting the Screening Requirements</h2>
						<p>Escorts like to follow some basic screening procedures for their personal safety. So, you will be asked to provide some form of official identification. The escort might ask you for your driving license, passport or some other form of identification.</p>
						<p>You can share the documentation that the escort asks for. And if you are listed on your company's website — on the About Us page — why not point that out to the escort or share your LinkedIn page or other social media presence that verifies your identity and image? If you work at a university and you have a page about yourself on the university's website, that's great and you should share a link to your official university page with the escort. It's all about developing trust.</p>
						<p>If you want to meet a top class high end escort, you will need to meet their screening requirements. There is no room for negotiation here. Once you are able to develop trust with the escort, you can even become a repeat customer.</p>
						<p>Professional escorts know about the value of discreetness and client confidentiality. So, you can rest assured about your interactions with professional escorts.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Being at Your BEST — Personal Hygiene and Looks Wise</h2>
						<p>Just as you would be at your best when attending that NYSE Closing event representing your company or just as you would be at your dashing best attending a felicitation ceremony in your company or attending the Paris Air Show or the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, you should obviously put in your best to impress the escort who is going to be absolutely stunning and obviously well-groomed as all professional escorts are.</p>
						<p>Whether you are part of a bachelor party or planning an escort encounter privately in your hotel or resort suite in your town, it is a given that you should be looking (and smelling) your best. So, you might like to take a proper bath and use your best deodorant or perfume and dress up in some nice clothing before your escort encounter.</p>
						<p>You can think of a first-time escort encounter like it's a first date kind of situation; so, why not bring out that new pair of shoes or that expensive new suit you have been saving for a special occasion? And certainly you can groom your facial hair in whatever fashion you prefer and in whatever style that makes you look dashing.</p>
						<p>And if you like to wear a Patek Philippe or Rolex on special occasions, fair enough — bring that out as well!</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Being on Time</h2>
						<p>Whether it's an incall or outcall session, it is important to be on time. If it's an incall and you are visiting the escort in a hotel room or the escort's home, you should be right on time — neither too early nor too late. It's like how rocket launches — whether to the Moon or Mars or the ISS or even to the outer planets — have to take place within a precise launch window for the payload to reach its destination. Not that escort encounters involve any 'rocket science.' Haha.</p>
						<p>It's just that if you are too early at the escort's location your escort may be getting ready or busy with another client — and if you delay reaching the escort's address the escort may grow anxious about whether you will show up or not. And such uncertainty will mean your escort encounter will begin on a wrong foot.</p>
						<p>And if it's an outcall the escort will reach your hotel room or other destination set by you on time but if you are somehow not ready then some precious time may be lost as you get ready. And the escort may have to leave on time after spending an hour or two as per your prior agreement and that might leave you feeling disappointed but then the escort may have other business to attend to and your delay will only mean a loss for you and the escort cannot be blamed for wanting to finish the session on time or wanting to leave on time.</p>
						<p>In summary, being on time simply shows that you respect the escort and value the time the escort has decided to spend with you.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Paying on Time, as Discreetly as Required</h2>
						<p>Things in the escort business work on the principle of the payment being made before the escort encounter starts. The payment can be made simply via cash put in an envelope with the envelope placed very visibly on a table in your hotel room or the escort's place which can likewise be a hotel room or the escort's home.</p>
						<p>It's better to take care of the payment business right at the start to avoid creating any awkward moments. Once you have put the cash at an obvious location, you can excuse yourself to make a phone call or to visit the bathroom so that the escort can safely store your cash in some place after counting it.</p>
						<p>So, whether it's $500 or $1,000 or $2,000 that you have agreed to pay upfront, you should make that payment. For other sort of arrangements like spending overnight, you may have agreed for some advance payment which you can make with the balance payment being taken care of as per your discussion or agreement with the escort.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Keeping the Escort Encounter Profession with No Personal or Unprofessional Questions</h2>
						<p>When you make the cash payment you must never ask the escort about the escort's tax situation even if you are just being or trying to be 'helpful.' It is up to individuals to take care of their tax situation — and escorts are individuals who earn money and have tax obligations (or not) depending on their level of income.</p>
						<p>Similarly, there is absolutely no reason to enquire about the escort's marital status or family background. Escorts are adults who are working professionals working in the escort industry just as other adults work in Wall Street or in journalism/media or banks or universities or in car manufacturing assembly lines or scientists or researchers or as stewardesses in airlines or in book shops or pastry shops or pizza outlets or restaurants or in a myriad of other small businesses.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Letting the Escort Decide the Pace of the Encounter</h2>
						<p>If you come to the escort session with preconceived notions and expectations about spending as much time as possible in physical action, then you are likely operating in amateur territory. An escort session comes in many flavors and getting physical is only a part of it and that may only happen as the session progresses and evolves and not as a fixed matter.</p>
						<p>Assuming the escort encounter does have a portion of time devoted to physical activities that will lead to some sublime and sensuous memories it makes sense that things will need to progress to that point in a slow and natural fashion.</p>
						<p>You have to get to know each other a little bit first and feel comfortable in each other's company before proceeding to more intimate stuff. In all these matters, the escort may be the party with the greater expertise. Hence, the escort will be better able to set the pace of the encounter.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Discovering and Discussing Things of Common Interest</h2>
						<p>You can begin with a cup of coffee or beer or share some wine at a hotel's or resort's bar — you may even go to a show or for some nice Italian, French or Japanese lunch or dinner. You can discuss things over brunch or a buffet.</p>
						<p>You could be a specialist like a cardiologist or a neurologist or a quant trader or algo trader who understands the intricacies of high frequency trading and much else. Or, you could be a Disney Imagineer or a sommelier or beer taster or tea taster or water slide tester or destination wedding photographer. No matter what your professional skills you can try to have a conversation with the escort about everyday things like favorite movies or favorite movie stars.</p>
						<p>You can discuss and marvel at how diversely talented humans can be and how humans can achieve mastery over something to an extraordinary degree that humbles all. Like Alex Honnold and his conquering El Capitan.</p>
						<p>You can discuss your dream job or hobbies — whether it is to chase eclipses across the world like Jay Pasachoff did or whether it is to rescue dogs with a small plane or it involves flying among Dubai's skyscrapers in a jet pack or it involves flying in the vicinity of the pyramids so that you happen to see one day a random dog on top of the pyramids.You can discuss your dream job or hobbies — whether it is to chase eclipses across the world like Jay Pasachoff did or whether it is to rescue dogs with a small plane or it involves flying among Dubai's skyscrapers in a jet pack or it involves flying in the vicinity of the pyramids so that you happen to see one day a random dog on top of the pyramids.</p>
						<p>You could discuss your favorite Hollywood monologues delivered by your favorite movie star — Al Pacino or Tom Cruise or Jack Nicholson or someone else. Or you could discuss your favorite jokes.</p>
						<p>"Viagra commercials are ridiculous. 'If you have an erection lasting more than four hours, call a doctor.' CALL A DOCTOR? I'd call everybody! 'Yo, check this out! It's like a sundial! You can hang towels on it!'" That's one from Robin Williams of course. You could go for George Carlin or Russell Peters or someone else that you like.</p>
						<p>If you happen to like reading fiction and so does the escort — or, both of you just enjoy beautiful writing — you could share Ann Patchett's writing such as this paragraph:</p>
						<p>
							"I see the past as it actually was," Maeve said. She was looking at the trees.
							"But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”
						</p>
						<p>You can share your amazement at Ms. Patchett's insights into life as evident in her use of imagery in this sentence: "There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”</p>
						<p>If you discover a common passion for books between you and the escort, you can perhaps mention Diana Athill's reason for placing an immense amount of value on books: "They brought home to me the central reason why books have meant so much to me. It is not because of my pleasure in the art of writing, though that has been very great. It is because they have taken me so far beyond the narrow limits of my own experience and have so greatly enlarged my sense of the complexity of life: of its consuming darkness, and also – thank God – of the light which continues to struggle through.”</p>
						<p>You could share Diane Ackerman's writing if you like her lyrical writing such as this: "Look at your feet. You are standing in the sky. When we think of the sky, we tend to look up, but the sky actually begins at the earth. We walk through it, yell into it, rake leaves, wash the dog, and drive cars in it. We breathe it deep within us. With every breath, we inhale millions of molecules of sky, heat them briefly, and then exhale them back into the world.”</p>
						<p>If you have liked Oliver Burkeman's writing and perspectives on living a happy life, you can share some of his writing such as this passage: "Our lives, thanks to their finitude, are inevitably full of activities that we're doing for the very last time. Just as there will be a final occasion on which I pick up my son … there will be a last time that you visit your childhood home, or swim in the ocean, or make love, or have a deep conversation with a certain close friend. Yet usually there'll be no way to know, in the moment itself, that you're doing it for the last time. Harris's point is that we should therefore try to treat every such experience with the reverence we'd show if it were the final instance of it. And indeed there's a sense in which every moment of life is a "last time.” It arrives; you'll never get it again—and once it's passed, your remaining supply of moments will be one smaller than before. To treat all these moments solely as stepping-stones to some future moment is to demonstrate a level of obliviousness to our real situation that would be jaw-dropping if it weren't for the fact that we all do it, all the time.”</p>
						<p>And if you as well as the escort happen to share a love for books and writing, perhaps you will both be fans of Carl Sagan and his writing in which case you can exchange notes about which of Sagan's books or passages are your favorites.</p>
						<p>Here's Sagan on books: "Books, purchasable at low cost, permit us to interrogate the past with high accuracy; to tap the wisdom of our species; to understand the point of view of others, and not just those in power; to contemplate — with the best teachers — the insights, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history. They allow people long dead to talk inside our heads. Books can accompany us everywhere. Books are patient where we are slow to understand, allow us to go over the hard parts as many times as we wish, and are never critical of our lapses. Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society.”</p>
						<p>There is really so much you can discuss to get to know each other and to set the stage for a great escort encounter — there is poetry you could share or how LLMs/AI tools like ChatGPT are upending so much that you could discuss.</p>
						<p>Having a bunch of things to talk about is a great way to ensure your time with the escort will pass in a memorable way and you can end up as a repeat client or customer for the escort thereby making sure you are always sure that you have someone you can spend time with no matter what other ups and downs you go through in your professional or personal life.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Respecting an Escort's "No"</h2>
						<p>Just as in a dating situation, so also in an escort encounter — if an escort says no to anything, you must respect the escort's wishes. Since physical interactions between you and an escort happens completely voluntarily, you have no reason to expect that you will be able to force yourself with an escort or have your way with an escort or that you will be able to coerce an escort.</p>
						<p>If you happen to have different ideas about how things should progress, the escort encounter will likely end there if you do not respect the escort's boundaries. So, if an escort asks you to stop, you must stop.</p>
						<p>You may also be asked by the escort to 'slow down' or 'be gentle' and you should act accordingly.</p>
						<p>Similarly, if you have certain desires, you can ask the escort if it is okay to try certain things out. If you want to take a break or hit pause or you want to ask the escort to do things just a bit differently, you can always make sure the escort is aware of how you like things to occur or proceed.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Respecting Time Limitations</h2>
						<p>Whether it's an incall or an outcall session, you will need to respect the time limitations built into the escort encounter or you will need to recognize that an escort encounter is a time bound affair.</p>
						<p>So, if it's an incall session, you will perhaps need to spend the last 10 or 15 minutes of your time with the escort in tidying things up or getting a quick shower and then getting ready to leave on time.</p>
						<p>Similarly, for outcall sessions, the escort will need to spend the last several minutes of your session in getting ready to leave your place — the escort may have other business to attend to and therefore respecting the value of time is paramount.</p>
						<br />
						<h2>Knowing Escort Etiquettes Will Make You a Valued Client — ALWAYS</h2>
						<p>When you know and remember these etiquettes and implement them as needed, you will ensure your time with the escort will be a pleasant time for both. It will be a memorable and fun experience and perhaps there will be an encore when you are back in town next year or whenever work or a professional event or get together brings you to town again.</p>
